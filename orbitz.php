				<p class="big">At Orbitz, I worked with Product Managers and Engineers to enhance the flight booking experience. From usability sessions and call center visits to visual designs and prototyping, we dug into the nooks and crannies of consumer flight shopping. Beyond flights, I among a large team of talented designers to deliver a consistent experience amongst our various teams and travel booking experiences.</p>

				<p>Orbitz served a tremendous amount of traffic to flight shoppers. We took advantage of this by consistently testing small and large iterations to our flight booking experience. A/B and multivariate testing enabled us to make informed decisions on what made for a smooth shopping process.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-2">Increase Hotel Bookings</h3>
				<p>During my tenure, one of Orbitz's key strategic points was to increase the booking of hotel nights. Orbitz was created by a group of airlines. We knew flight booking well. However, by focusing the company on more profitable hotel bookings, Orbitz aimed to satisfy consumer demand while also creating a healthier business. For the flight team, this meant we did a long series of tests throughout the purchase funnel pushing the benefits of booking flights and hotels together.</p>
