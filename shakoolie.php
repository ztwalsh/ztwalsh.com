				<p>I co-founded Shakoolie with my partner in 2011. From a  $1k investement, we've created a product driving $250k in annual revenue&mdash;and do it all. From building an ecommerce site to handling assembly and fulfillment to advertising and working with customers, Shakoolie has been a great experience in running all aspects of an active business. Here are some highlights:</p>

				<h3 class="heading-2">Ecommerce Experience</h3>
				<p>When it came to our website, we had a simple mission: Make it easy to find what we're selling and make it easy to see what you're gonna get. Shakoolie is a novelty item often given as a gift. It's also a pretty unique, so shoppers need to feel like they can become familiar with the product. We made a very easy-to-use mobile and desktop experience for shopping and browsing and put emphasis on our photos to make sure people can see, in detail, what they will be getting.</p>

					The category page is set up to make seeing our range of koozie design easy.
					<br /><br />
					The product page was built as a showroom for our koozies. Large photos of the koozie and its parts give buyers the visual information they need to add to cart.</figcaption>

				<h3 class="heading-2">Product Design</h3>
				<p>We started simple. We offered one koozie design and ordered a batch of 200. We didn't know what to expect, but to our astonishment, they started selling. Since then, we've expanded out product line to offer a variety of designs. Over time, we've seen these take off as gift items so today we gear our desings towards occasions where you'd want to buy a gift for someone in your life. We market them fo occasions like christmas, weddings, mother's and father's day...you name it. We've still stayed true to our original design.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-3">We Try, Fail, and Try Again to Find What Sells</h3>
					As a ux and product designer, iteration is a part of my job. It's been fun to take that principal and apply it to developing designs that resonate with real people.
					<br /><br />
					We have had many different designs over the years. We'll do short runs of new designs, see what sticks, and move on. It's been a great way to keep the idea train running while also keeping inventory bloat light.

					<h3 class="heading-3">We Make Customers Excited to Get Their Order</h3>
					Our shipping packaging started as anything but exciting. Simpe Tyvek envelopes, the stark white polymailers. As we've grown, though, we wanted to add excitement to the moment the customer sees that Shakoolie package on their front door.
					<br /><br />
					We chose to go long on our bold blue color and added the simple phrase "Take me to your Shower" to make the experience of opening feel special.
