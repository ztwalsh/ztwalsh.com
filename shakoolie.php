				<p class="big">I co-founded Shakoolie with my partner in 2011. From a $1k investment, we've created a product topping $250k in annual revenue. From building an ecommerce site to handling assembly and fulfillment to display advertising and customer service, Shakoolie steeps us in all aspects of a growing side-business.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-2">Effecive Ecommerce Experience</h3>
				<p>When it comes to our website, we have a simple mission: Make it easy to find what we're selling and make it easy to imagine what you're going to get. Shakoolie is a unique novelty gift that people may not have seen before. Shoppers need to feel like they can become familiar with and ultimately trust the product they buy.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-2">Product Design</h3>
				<p>Shakoolie started as a very simple offering: one koozie design showcased on a Wordpress page. To our astonishment, they started selling. Since then, we've expanded our product line to offer a variety of designs and have created a process for designing and testing new ideas.</p>

				<p>Over time, we noticed Shakoolie's traction as a gift item, so today we gear our designs around occasions for gift-giving. Christmas, Weddings, Mother's Day, Father's Day&mdash;we have the perfect Shower Beer Koozie for any gift-giving need.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-3">Design for a Reason</h3>
					We rarely design random things. We listen to what's going on and to how people talk about Shakoolie. From there we make our best bet on what designs will be successful.

					<h3 class="heading-3">Test and Decide</h3>
					For new designs we do short runs to see what sticks. When it doesn't work, we move on. This keeps ideas flowing while keeping inventory light.

				<h3 class="heading-2">Memorable Shipping Packaging</h3>
				<p>A customer should be excited when a package arrives. In the beginning, we filled orders in the standard, white poly mailers. Today, however, we've elevated our materials to create a shipping package with personality that stands out from other parcels. We push our bold, blue brand color to instill visual recognition and use the line "Take me to your shower" to remind them what's inside.</p>
