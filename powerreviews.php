				<p class="big">At PowerReviews, I've served as the lead designer for the company as it grew from 8 to 150 employees. As we grew, I helped lead the creation of the design discovery process. Through this process, we've made fundamental updates in the ways we collect and display content and in the ways that we deliver that content back to the customers we serve.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-2">Collecting & Displaying Review Content</h2>
				<p>PowerReviews' core offering is the ability to collect and display content. When I first started with PowerReviews, this core product hadn't been touched in quite a long time and there were problems. First off, neither the display nor the collection form were mobile-friendly. The display was very cluttered with all types of information and was visually out-dated. The collection form used very small, cumbersome form fields and followed a flow which included steps that hampered completion rates.</p>

				<p>We first set out to update the form. We analized usage and decided to kill a preview step, resulting in a 20% bump in completion. I created a responsive design for the form that bumped mobile completion up by 30%. For the display, we conducted sessions with shoppers to determine the most important aspects of a display. From there we created a responsive display template that brought visual emphasis to those elements and pulled out any information not considered mission critical.</p>

				<p>The outcome was a better performing, fully responsive product offering with a modern visual design that is designed to be customized.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-3">Summarize first, then details</h3>
					From our shopper interviews, we consistently saw a pattern of people looking at star ratings to evaluate quality and the number of reviews to validate that score. From there people oten want to know "what's bad" about a product. They'll skim through negative reviews looking for those things. It was this insight that informed us on where we could stand to improve our display.

					<h3 class="heading-3">Flexible and customizable</h3>
					With the revamped display, we created a fully responsive solution with information organized in a way to help the shopper. When it came to out visual design, though, we developed a pretty simple and clean brand standard as we knew our 1300+ clients would want to customize to match their brand.

					<h3 class="heading-3">Make completion easy</h3>
					The forms before included verbose instructions and product descriptions. That coupled with a cluttered design made it feel as if you may miss something. We wanted to focus on creating an effective form, optimized for completion. We striped out all superfluous text and designed a set of form fields that would still help the reviewer along.

				<h2 class="heading-2">Redesigning the Dashboard</h2>
				<p>While the first 18 months of my time at PowerReviews was spent updating the core product, in the back of many of our minds, we knew we needed a better dashboard experience for our customers. Our clients pay us good money, and while they were certainly getting the value of having the content on their site, we weren't giving them great tools to access and mine insights from what they were collecting.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-3">Before: Slow, Cumbersome, No Sales Appeal</h3>
				<p>The intial dashboard was about 7 years old. Another designer I worked with did his best to put a new coat of paint on it with some simple style updates, but the problems ran deeper. The home page offered little to no takeawy about activity. Forms were overwhelming making it feel like content was burried. And the application as a whole was slow. Take a look.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-3">Forms can be friends, but some are enimies</h3>
					The old ways to search for reviews required a form that is less than helpful in helping you find what you need. Little organizational attention was given to the fields.

					<h3 class="heading-3">Oh, the Clutter</h3>
					Having the right information is crucial, but organizing it in a way that puts focus on something is as well. The old card contained a lot of information which drew emphasis away from the meat of the content itself. You can see that was remedied by highlighting the key content&mdash;a design addition where reduction was needed.

					<h3 class="heading-3">A lot of clicks for something simple</h3>
					The old version required a client to "check-out" content, change it's status, and then check it back in. That's quite an order of operations to do something that simple. Imagine, if you're the person who moderates all reviews? Those extra clicks quickly turn to hours.

			<h3 class="heading-3">After: Findable Content and Sales-worthy design</h3>
			<p>Leading up to the redesign, we ran surveys and uncovered that the key pain points were the analytics and moderation sections. As you saw above, we started by rebuilding our reporting tool from the groud up. As we tackled the second big complaint, the content moderation tool, we decided to use this as an opportunityt o redesign the whole dashboard experience. We wanted to build a tool that attracts prospects and blows our csutomers away, keeping them as customers for longer.</p>

			<p>We started doing the basics better. We updated the information architecture create a more logical and intuitive flow. We stripped out complexity and bloat from the UIs whever possible. We revamped the visual design to be more modern and to better align with our overall brand. He's a look.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-3">Clearer Navigation, At-A-Glance Homepage</h3>
					We started by asking "What products can a client have, and what's important for those sections?" This helped us draw up a clear navigation and informed the content needed for the dashboard home page. The result is a helpful page when you first log in and an easy way to get around.

					<h3 class="heading-3">Less Intimidating Forms</h3>
					As you saw above, the old forms were pretty lifeless and did nothing to coach the customer through using it. We are not an everyday tool. Are customers log in weekly or monthly, so we want to keep our learning curve low. By breaking down forms into sections and removing infrequently used fields, we've given clients a much friendlier form that helps them find the content they need.

					<h3 class="heading-3">Design that Focuses on Content</h3>
					We removed or hid meta information to bring focus to the content itself. As a client scrolls hrough pages and pages of reviews, the reduction in visual noise makes it easier for them to scan.
