				<p class="big">At PowerReviews, I've served the company first as the lead designer and then as its Director of User Experience while it grew from 8 to 150 employees. I contributed to the creation of our product discovery process, our design sprint workflow, the redevelopment of our core software offering, and the redesign of the customer dashboard experience.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-2">Collecting & Displaying Review Content</h2>
				<p>Initially, PowerReviews' review display and collection software was outdated both in terms of technology and design. Despite the massive increase in mobile shopping, the display itself was not mobile compatible. Over the course of the first 18 months, I led research and design in transitioning the display and forms into the modern, mobile-friendly solutions they are today.</p>

				<p>The design considerations were unique for this project: with over 1,000 sites, we had to account for countless variations in display as well as a visual design that leant itself to being customized by well-known brands.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-2">Redesigning the Dashboard</h2>
				<p>Our initial dashboard was about 7 years old when we bit off a redesign. To that point it had been an afterthought that developed in a purely functional form. However, the home page didn't give you quick take-aways. The analytics tool was purely data tables lacking conclusions. Access to your collected content was blocked by cumbersome search forms. And the visual design was effectively non-existent.</p>

				<p>With our redesign, we sought to build an intuitive tool with a consistent design system focused on being informative and and effective in task completion.</p>

					The lack of organization and coupled with an intimidating number of fields served as a blocker for our customers in finding their content. The learning curve was high.
