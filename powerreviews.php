					<p class="big">If you've shopped on sites like Jet.com, The North Face, Whirlpool, or Toys 'R Us, chances are you've seen PowerReviews' software in action. PowerReviews provides retailers and brands tools to collect and display product reviews on their Ecommerce sites.</p>

				<p>At PowerReviews, I've served as the lead designer for the company as it grew from 8 to 150 employees. As we grew, I helped lead the creation of the design discovery process. Through this process, we've made fundamental updates in the ways we colect and display content and in the ways that we deliver that content back to the customers we serve.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-2">Collecting & Displaying Content</h3>
				<p>When it came to our website, we had a simple mission: Make it easy to find what we're selling and make it easy to see what you're gonna get. Shakoolie is a novelty item often given as a gift. It's also a pretty unique, so shoppers need to feel like they can become familiar with the product. We made a very easy-to-use mobile and desktop experience for shopping and browsing and put emphasis on our photos to make sure people can see, in detail, what they will be getting.</p>

					The category page is set up to make seeing our range of koozie design easy.
					<br /><br />
					The product page was built as a showroom for our koozies. Large photos of the koozie and its parts give buyers the visual information they need to add to cart.</figcaption>

					<h3 class="heading-3">We Try, Fail, and Try Again to Find What Sells</h3>
					As a ux and product designer, iteration is a part of my job. It's been fun to take that principal and apply it to developing designs that resonate with real people.
					<br /><br />
					We have had many different designs over the years. We'll do short runs of new designs, see what sticks, and move on. It's been a great way to keep the idea train running while also keeping inventory bloat light.

					<h3 class="heading-3">We Make Customers Excited to Get Their Order</h3>
					Our shipping packaging started as anything but exciting. Simpe Tyvek envelopes, the stark white polymailers. As we've grown, though, we wanted to add excitement to the moment the customer sees that Shakoolie package on their front door.
					<br /><br />
					We chose to go long on our bold blue color and added the simple phrase "Take me to your Shower" to make the experience of opening feel special.
